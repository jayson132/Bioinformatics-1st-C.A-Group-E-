Bioinformatics is a fascinating field that bridges the gap between biology and computer science.
Bioinformatics is the use of computational tools and techniques to analyze, interpret, and manage biological data. This data can come from various sources, including DNA sequences, protein structures, gene expression patterns, and more.
With the explosion of biological data generated by modern research techniques, bioinformatics plays a crucial role in making sense of it all.
